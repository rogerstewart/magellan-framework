# Introduction #

This will eventually be a guide for developers building or changing the Magellan code.

Some quick notes:

  * We use semantic versioning: http://semver.org/
  * There is a build.cmd that you can run to compile and produce the artefacts (source code drop, binaries, gem, etc.)
  * You'll need to install Ruby (1.9.1) to be able to package the gems
